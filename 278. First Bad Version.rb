# You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.
# Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.
# You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which returns whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

# 1 <= bad <= n <= 2^31 - 1


# The is_bad_version API is already defined for you.
# @param {Integer} version
# @return {boolean} whether the version is bad
# def is_bad_version(version):

# @param {Integer} n
# @return {Integer}
